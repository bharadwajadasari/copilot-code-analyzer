## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `setup_database.py` (NEW)
- Simple script to create and initialize SQLite database locally
- Creates `analysis_data.db` with proper schema
- Adds sample activity data with realistic confidence scores
- Self-contained database setup for local development

### 2. `LOCAL_DASHBOARD_SETUP.md` (MODIFIED)

- Clear steps for local development setup
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Explains SQLite vs PostgreSQL usage

### 3. `test_local_dashboard.py` (NEW)

## Database Structure
- **analysis_results**: Repository analysis data
- **file_analysis**: Individual file activity tracking
- **monitoring_status**: Repository monitoring configuration
- **metrics_cache**: Performance caching

## Sample Data Included
- 4 activity entries with realistic confidence scores:
  - `analyzer/balanced_detector.py`: 38.9% (HIGH risk)
  - `test_balanced_detector_debug.py`: 23.4% (MEDIUM risk)
  - `main.py`: 12.5% (LOW risk)
  - `dashboard/server.py`: 6.7% (MINIMAL risk)

## API Endpoints Working
- `/api/activity` - Returns activity data with proper confidence scores
- `/api/repositories` - Repository listing
- `/api/repository/{path}/summary` - Summary data

## Testing Results
✅ Database creation: SUCCESS
✅ Activity API endpoint: WORKING
✅ Sample data verification: COMPLETE
✅ Dashboard activity page: POPULATED
