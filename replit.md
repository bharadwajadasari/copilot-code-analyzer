# Copilot Code Analysis Tool

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Python-based tool that analyzes code repositories to detect and track GitHub Copilot vs human-written code patterns. The application provides real-time monitoring, web dashboard visualization, and external analytics integration capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Analysis Engine** (`analyzer/`): Core AI detection algorithms and metrics calculation
- **Web Dashboard** (`dashboard/`): Flask-based web interface for visualization
- **File Monitoring** (`monitoring/`): Real-time file system watching capabilities
- **Data Management** (`storage/`): SQLite-based persistence layer
- **External Integration** (`api/`): REST API client for external analytics platforms
- **Utilities** (`utils/`): Shared logging, configuration, and helper functions

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.8+, Flask web framework
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage
- **File Monitoring**: Watchdog library for real-time file system events
- **Git Integration**: GitPython for repository analysis
- **External APIs**: Requests library for HTTP communication
- **Command Line Interface**: Click framework for CLI interactions

## Key Components

### 1. AI Detection Engine
The system includes multiple detection algorithms with varying accuracy levels:

- **Enhanced Detector** (`analyzer/enhanced_detector.py`): Multi-dimensional analysis with statistical pattern recognition
- **Accurate AI Detector** (`analyzer/accurate_ai_detector.py`): Comprehensive pattern matching including explicit AI markers
- **Balanced Detector** (`analyzer/balanced_detector.py`): Calibrated for realistic detection rates
- **Conservative Detector** (`analyzer/conservative_detector.py`): Ultra-conservative approach to minimize false positives

### 2. Web Dashboard
Flask-based dashboard providing:
- Repository overview and statistics
- Real-time activity monitoring
- File-level analysis results
- Interactive data visualization
- Bootstrap 5 UI with responsive design

### 3. External Analytics Platform
Node.js/Express-based external platform for:
- Event ingestion from IntelliJ plugin
- API key management
- Real-time analytics processing
- WebSocket-based live updates

### 4. File System Monitoring
Real-time monitoring capabilities:
- Debounced file change detection
- Multi-threaded analysis processing
- Configurable file pattern matching
- Event batching for performance

## Data Flow

1. **Analysis Trigger**: Repository analysis initiated via CLI command or file system events
2. **File Discovery**: System scans for supported file types while respecting ignore patterns
3. **Content Analysis**: Each file processed through AI detection algorithms
4. **Pattern Matching**: Multiple detection techniques applied (explicit markers, structural patterns, statistical analysis)
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Weighted scoring system produces confidence percentages
6. **Result Storage**: Analysis results persisted to SQLite database
7. **Visualization**: Results displayed through web dashboard
8. **External Integration**: Metrics optionally sent to external analytics platforms

## External Dependencies

### Python Dependencies
- `flask>=2.3.0`: Web framework for dashboard
- `click>=8.0.0`: Command-line interface framework
- `gitpython>=3.1.0`: Git repository integration

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
1. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r setup_requirements.txt`
2. Configure settings in `config.json`
3. Run analysis: `python main.py analyze -r /path/to/repository`
4. Start dashboard: `python main.py dashboard`

### Production Deployment
- **Standalone Application**: Direct Python execution on target systems
- **Docker Containerization**: Containerized deployment for consistent environments
- **External Analytics**: Separate Node.js service for analytics processing
- **Database**: SQLite for single-user, PostgreSQL for multi-user analytics platform

### IntelliJ Plugin Integration
- Gradle-based plugin build system
- Real-time code analysis within IDE
- Event publishing to external analytics platform
- Background processing to avoid IDE performance impact
